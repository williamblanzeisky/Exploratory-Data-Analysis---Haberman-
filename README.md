# Exploratory Data-Analysis on the Haberman's dataset

This repository contains an ipython notebook where I performed exploratory data analysis on the infamous Haberman's dataset from Kaggle. The dataset can be found on Kaggle and also attached in this repository. In this project, I intend to:
1. classify patients whether or not they can live within 5 years or if they'd die after breast cancer surgery based on the age, number of positive axillary nodes, date of the performed operation

2. Selecting features that would contribute the most to the classification by looking at the probability distribution function (PDF) and cumulative distribution function (CDF)


I found that the only feature in the dataset that separates the status well, is the number of nodes. The detailed explanation can be found on the ipython notebook.
